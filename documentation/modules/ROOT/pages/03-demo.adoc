= See the Solution in Action

== Setup the solution

To provision the demo you will perform the following steps - each of which are explained in detail in the next sections:

* Gain access to Red Hat OpenShift. This solution pattern has been tested on https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/welcome/index.html[OpenShift 4.15^]
* Ensure you have the tools `oc` and `ansible` installed in your local environment such as your laptop
* Access the OpenShift cluster with cluster-admin privileges
* Log in to OpenShift with `cluster-admin` role via cli
* Run the Ansible playbook
* Run a  bunch of scripts to deploy the Solution Pattern in your OpenShift cluster

// [%interactive]
//* [ ] Binge watch Death in Paradise
//* [ ] Visit a tropical island

=== Pre-requisites
Here is the list of tools you need in your local enviroment so that you can use the automated installation.

* https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[OpenShift CLI (oc client)^]
* https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html[Ansible CLI ^] with https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/kubernetes/core/k8s_module.html[Ansible kubernetes.core module^]

To check if you have the cli tools, you can open your terminal and use following commands:

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
oc version #openshift cli client
ansible --version
ansible-galaxy --version
ansible-galaxy collection list #the list should include kubernetes.core
----

If you can't see `kubernetes.core` collection listed, you can install it with `ansible-galaxy`:

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
ansible-galaxy collection install kubernetes.core
----


=== Installing the demo

* Login to your OpenShift cluster as cluster-admin (because a number of operators will need to be installed)
* Click on the username on the top right hand, and then click on *Copy login command*. This will open another tab and you will need to login again
* Click on *Display token* link, and copy the command under  *Log in with this token*. This will look like this
[source,shell script]
----
oc login --token=<token> --server=<server>
----

* Clone the ansible scripts as follows in an appropriate folder in your local environment

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
git clone https://github.com/rh-solution-pattern-api-versioning/globex-ansible
----

Run the following command to setup the fundamental config needed. Ensure that the ansible playbook is deployed without errors

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
ansible-playbook playbook.yml  --skip-tags "apim"
----

* This is the output you get from the above ansible command:

[example]
----

=====

[#_walkthrough_guide]
== Workshop Walkthrough guide

Here is an overview of what you will achieve

image::steps.png[]

[NOTE]
====
The Design, Govern and Mock phases of API lifecycle has been discussed in other solutions patterns; so in this pattern we will skip straight to the implementing API versioning. So, this solution pattern focuses on how 3scale API management and OpenShift can help with API versioning. 

====



=== Step 1: Overview

Let's walk through an overview of the components that have been setup already

* Launch the https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%[OpenShift console^,window=console]  and login
* Navigate to *Topolgy* from the Developer's view of the `globex-user1` project
+
image::globex-user1.png[]
** The center section under the name *globex-app-user1* contains the components needed for the first version of the application and the api.
*** `globex-ui` is the retail website
*** `order-placement` is the microservice which implements the OrderPlacement API
*** `catalog` and `inventory` components provide the services needed for the retail websites.
** The left section *v1-1* is the (future looking) setup for v1-1. 
*** This is at zero pods at the moment because the corresponding API version is not setup yet
** The right *v2-0* is the (future looking) setup for v2-0. 
*** This is at zero pods at the moment because the corresponding API version is not setup yet

===  Step 2: Enable Version 1.0.0

==== API specification and governance

The version 1.0.0 of this *Globex Order Placement API* has already be created for you. This can be viewed in github https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rh-soln-pattern-api-versioning/api-spec/main/v1.0/OrderPlacementAPI-V1.0.yaml[here^]. You can note that the version 

```
openapi: 3.0.2
info:
    title: OrderPlacementAPI V1.0
    version: 1.0.0
    description: 'API Call to place an order with product, address and user details'
    license:
        name: MIT License
        url: 'https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT'

```

==== *[As a backend developer]* Setup OrderPlacement backend service 

The backend of OrderPlacement API for the purpose of this demo, acts as a facade to receive the payload, and then posts the Order payload to a https://webhook.site/[https://webhook.site/^]. 

[TIP]
====
In real life, there are a number ways this payload can be handled

* payload maybe be processed asynchoronously through a event driven architecture
* payload maybe stored in a a SQL based database or a no-SQL database
* payload maybe need to be posted to a number of other downstream systems.
====

* As seen earlier, the OrderPlacement backend service has already been provisioned for you. You will now need to
* The *ORDER_PLACEMENT_API* env variable of the OrderPlacement backend service has a placeholder which needs to be replaced.
+
image:order-placement-config-before.png[]
+
* Launch https://webhook.site/[https://webhook.site/^], and copy the the URL displayed as *Your unique URL* by clicking on it 
+
image:webhook-site-unique-url.png[]
* From your command prompt, set an environment variable
+
```
export WEBHOOKSITE=<webhoot.site url that you copied in the previous step>
```
* Run the following command to update the backend service's environment variables.
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
oc set env deployments/order-placement --overwrite ORDER_PLACEMENT_API=$WEBHOOKSITE -n globex-user1
----
** You will see the output `deployment.apps/order-placement updated`
** This is how the env variables of the  the Order Placement service will look like after update. 
image:order-placement-config-after.png[]
* Any payload being POSTed to this service will now be sent to this webhook site for inspection. 
+
[TIP]
====
Instead of a plain JSON order payload, you can consider the payload to be a https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents^]. CloudEvents can then hold versions in their headers which makes it easier to route to different down stream systems through (for e.g.) using Knative Eventing 
====

==== *[As an API Provider]* Setup 3scale entities

Just like the code, all the 3scale Custom Resources are also maintained in git and are managed through ArgoCD/GitOps. This helps to version the 3scale entities as well.

. Run this command from where you have cloned the ansible playbook in the first step.
** This command will use the git branch `1.0.0` as the source of truth since we start with version `1.0.0`
** This command will create version 1.0.0 of 3scale Backend, Product, Application Plans, Developer Account and the Application for the account as well
+
[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
ansible-playbook playbook.yml  --skip-tags "main" --extra-vars "apim_gitops_repo_value=https://github.com/rh-soln-pattern-api-versioning/api-versioning-helm apim_gitops_repo_tag_value=1.0.0"
----
. Click on https://3scale-user1-admin.%SUBDOMAIN%[3scale^,window=3scale] to view all the entities that have been created for you. Login using (user1/openshift)
+
image:apim-v100-overview.png[] 
. Note that the *Globex Order Placement Product* and *Globex Order Placement Backend* are now created.
. *ActiveDoc* can be viewed under *Globex Order Placement Product -> ActiveDocs*
+
[NOTE] 
====
* ActiveDoc is created with OpenApi Specs. For the purpose of this solution pattern we are using a prebuilt OpenAPI.  
* Apicurio API designer is a great too to build API designs. You can then manage it with Apicurio Service Registry
====

. In 3scale, navigate to from the *Globex Order Placement* navigate to *Product-> Integration ->  Methods and Metrics* to view what's been setup.
+
[NOTE]
====
Methods and Metrics help us to map different backend services for different URL versions, and also help to track metrics based on hits for different backend service versions
====
+
image::methods-100.png[]
. Now click on *Maping Rules* link. The Mapping rules help to route a request to the right version of backend service (e.g. /v1/placeorder)
+
```
E.g. `api.globex.com/v1/OrderPlacement` will go to `v1`  backend service
```
+
image::methods-v100-mapping-rules.png[]
** The Mapping Rule with the pattern `/{version}` also helps to track all the metric to Globex Order Placement API in total.

. Before you can start accessing the Globex Order Placement API, you must promote the APIcast configuration as below. +
+
[TIP]
====
APIcast is an NGINX based API gateway used to integrate your internal and external API services with the Red Hat 3scale Platform. In this workshop we use the two built-in APICast (staging and production) that come by default with the 3scale installation. They come pre-configured and ready to use out-of-the-box.
====

. From https://3scale-user1-admin.%SUBDOMAIN%[3scale homepage^,window=3scale], under the Products section, click on *Globex Order Placement* to view the Product's overview page. From the left hand menu, navigate to *Integration* > *Configuration*
. Under *APIcast Configuration*, click *Promote to v.x Staging APICast* to promote the APIcast configurations. Similarly click *Promote to v.x Production APICast* 
+
image::apim-promote-prod.png[]
** Note that  *Globex Order Placement Backend* shows that the backend is mapped as "v1". The API will then be accessed via *v1* path. This helps in versioning this OrderPlacement API as *1.0.0*

==== *[As a Consumer]* Globex UI patched with API Credentials and APICast URL

Next step, patch the `globex-ui` deployment with the API credentials and the APIcast URL. Typically developers get APICredentials from the Developer Portal.  

. Navigate to *Audience (from top nav) -> Developer Portal -> Visit Portal*
+
image::access-devportal.png[]
. 
. Sign in using (*dev.globex/openshift*)
+
image::dev-portal-login.png[]
. Click on *API credentials* link on top nav, and you will see *Globex Basic Application* 
** Copy the alphanumeric value found as *User Key* and create environement variable `API_USER_KEY_VALUE`
+
image::application-credentials-1.0.png[]
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
export API_USER_KEY_VALUE=<replace with user key>
----
** Run the following command to update the backend service's env variables.
+
[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
oc set env deployments/globex-ui --overwrite API_USER_KEY_VALUE=$API_USER_KEY_VALUE  \
API_TRACK_PLACEORDER=https://globex-order-placement-product-3scale-user1-apicast-staging.%SUBDOMAIN%/v1/placeorder -n globex-user1
----
** You should see a message `deployment.apps/globex-ui updated`


==== Testing this out

. Launch the https://globex-ui-globex-user1.%SUBDOMAIN%/[retail website^]
. Login using any valid email address and any 6-digit password - since this is just a simulation.
. Navigate to the *Cool Stuff Store* from the top menu. Add a few things to cart. 
. Click on *Cart* from the top menu and *Proceed to Checkout*. 
. Click on *Autofill form* to make it easy to fill this form. 
+
image::globex-ui-v-100.png[]
. Click on *Submit Order*
. You must see a success message
+
image::globex-ui-order-submit.png[]

. You can view the payload on the webhook.site that you setup
+
image::webhook-v100.png[]

==== View Traffic Analytics
. Try placing a few orders to generate traffic. You can also place dummy orders by invoking the APICast endpoint on Postman or similar. 
** Append the following endpoint with the *API credentials* for the application created. If needed, click <<#user-key-access,  instructions>> to see how to access API credentials.
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
https://globex-order-placement-product-3scale-user1-apicast-staging.%SUBDOMAIN%/v1/placeorder?user_key=<user key from Application>
----

. Navigate to https://3scale-user1-admin.%SUBDOMAIN%[3scale Dashboard^,window=3scale], and click on *globex-order-placement* to view the Product Details
. Click on the *Analytics -> Traffic* link on the left hand side menu. You will see the *Hits* details. 
. This section provides insights in terms of the number of hits for the product and other traffic analysis details as well.
+
image:apim-traffic.png[]
 

===  Step 3: Enable Version 1.1.0
In this setp let's introduce version 1.1.0 of OrderPlacement API. A non-breaking change is introduced to allow for a new field called *Delivery Instructions*.

The following summarizes some of the critical impact across the different personas

. As an *API provider*
** Use APICurio studio to make changes to  OpenAPI Specification to include Optional field *Delivery Instructions* and change version from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0
** Publish this on Apicurio Service Registry
** Update  3scale for new Backend (version 1.1.0), update Product to point to the Backend version 1.1.0, update ActivdDoc
** Point to new Backend service which adheres to the new API specification
+
[NOTE]
====
As mentioned earlier the APICurio studio and Apicurio Service Registry changes are not included to keep this solution pattern accessible and not overtly too lengthy.
====

. As a *Backend service developer*
** Create a new branch with name *v1.1.0* and change the Order Placement service to allow for *Delivery Instructions*
** Update any POJOs or mapping - ideally it is better to handle this as a JSON payload rather than mapping to a POJO so as to allow for minimal impact
** Update validations against new OpenAPI spec. In our case we use JSON Schema based validation.

. As an *API consumer*
** May choose to consume the new API at their own pace.
** Changes includ update to the UI to allow for the new field *Delivery Instructions*. 
** Change any validations if necessary. Ensure adherence to new OpenAPI specification

==== *[As a backend developer]* New version 1.1.0 of the backend service

* The backend service deployment for version 1.1.0 has been already deployed, but is set as replica 0 (i.e, it is at zero pods)
** The OpenAPI specification has been upgrade with optional *Delivery Instructions*. You can view the version https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rh-soln-pattern-api-versioning/api-spec/main/v1.1/OrderPlacementAPI-V1.1.yaml[1.1.0 here^]
```
openapi: 3.0.2
info:
    title: OrderPlacementAPI V1.1
    version: 1.1.0
    description: 'API Call to place an order with product, address and user details'
    license:
        name: MIT License
        url: 'https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT'
...<snip>...
        delivery_instructions:
          description: Send optional delivery instructions
...<snip>...
```
** The OpenAPI specification for this version 1.1.0 has been converted onto JSON Schema and is part of this backend service. Click here to view the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rh-soln-pattern-api-versioning/order-placement-service/1.1.0/src/main/java/org/globex/retail/json-schema/order-placement-payload.json[version 1.1.0 JSON Schema^]. Note the introduction of *delivery_instructions* field which is optional
+
image::json-schema-v110.png[width=60%]
* Patch this deployment with the webhook.site URL that you have setup earlier. 
** From your command prompt `echo $WEBHOOKSITE` to make sure you have the env variable accessible
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
echo $WEBHOOKSITE
----

** Run the following command to update the backend service's environment variables, and scale the replica to `1`
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
oc set env deployments/order-placement-v1-1-0 --overwrite ORDER_PLACEMENT_API=$WEBHOOKSITE -n globex-user1
oc scale deployment order-placement-v1-1-0 --replicas=1 -n globex-user1
----
*** Output would be like this
+
```
deployment.apps/order-placement-v1-1-0 updated
deployment.apps/order-placement-v1-1-0 scaled
```

==== *[As an API Provider]* Configure 3scale entities for version 1.1.0

. Run this command from the command prompt from where you have cloned the ansible playbook.
** This command will use the git branch `1.1.0` as the source of truth since we are now rolling out version `1.1.0`
** This command will create version 1.1.0 of 3scale Backend, Product, Application Plans, Developer Account and the Application for the account as well
+
[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
ansible-playbook playbook.yml  --skip-tags "main" --extra-vars "apim_gitops_repo_value=https://github.com/rh-soln-pattern-api-versioning/api-versioning-helm apim_gitops_repo_tag_value=1.1.0"
----
** The output will be like this
+
```
PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=12   changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=3    rescued=0    ignored=0
```

. From 3scale promote APICast configuration from *Globex Order Placement Product -> Integration -> Configuration -> *Promote to v.x Staging APICast* and *Promote to v.x Production APICast* 

==== [As an API Consumer] Update UI to updated version 1.1.0

[TIP]
====
This is a backward compatible change. Therefore, the existing *globex-ui 1.0.0* deployment will work as it is without any changes with the new *Backend  1.1.0* version. You can test this out just to be sure :)
====

When the UI developers are ready, they can make the following changes to start consuming the new changes, and send the new Delivery Instructions as part of the order payload.

* Run this command to update the image of globex-ui deployment to the 1.1.0 version
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
oc set image deployment/globex-ui globex-ui=quay.io/rh_soln_pattern_api_versioning/globex-ui:1.1.0 -n globex-user1

----

==== Testing this out (version 1.1.0)
. Launch the https://globex-ui-globex-user1.%SUBDOMAIN%/[retail website^] preferrably in incognito - or perform a hard refresh of the browser to nullify caching. 
. Login using any valid email address and any 6-digit password.
. Navigate to the *Cool Stuff Store* from the top menu. Add a few things to the card and proceed to checkout
. Notice that there is a new field called *Delivery Instructions*. Provide some content for this new field, and click on *Submit Order*
+
image::delivery-instructions.png[]
* You should see a confirmation message that the order has been placed.
* Navigate to the webhook.site you have setup to check that the *delivery_instructions* is being passed on correctly
+
image::delivery-instructions-webhook.png[]


===  Step 4: Enable Version 2.0.0
In this setp let's introduce version 2.0.0 of OrderPlacement API. A breaking change is introduced to merge *First name and Last name* into a single field. 

The same set of impact identified  across the different personas while introducing version 1.1.0 also applies for a Major version change. The main impact is that, this version is NOT backward compatible. 

==== *[As a backend developer]* New version of the backend service

. The backend service deployment for version 2.0.0 is in place to keep this pattern simple, but is set as replica 0 (i.e, it is at zero pods)
** The OpenAPI specification for this version 2.0.0 has been converted onto JSON Schema and is part of this backend service. Click here to view the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rh-soln-pattern-api-versioning/order-placement-service/2.0.0/src/main/java/org/globex/retail/json-schema/order-placement-payload.json[version 2.0.0 JSON Schema^]. Note the introduction of *delivery_instructions* field which is optional
+
image::json-schema-v200.png[width=60%]
. You will need to patch this deployment as well with the *webhook.site URL* that you have setup earlier. 
** From your command prompt `echo $WEBHOOKSITE` to make sure you have the env variable accessible
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
echo $WEBHOOKSITE
----

** Run the following command to update the (version 2.0.0) backend service's environment variables, and scale the replica to `1`
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
oc set env deployments/order-placement-v2-0 --overwrite ORDER_PLACEMENT_API=$WEBHOOKSITE -n globex-user1
oc scale deployments/order-placement-v2-0 --replicas=1 -n globex-user1
----
*** Output would be like this
+
```
deployment.apps/order-placement-v2-0 updated
deployment.apps/order-placement-v2-0 scaled
```

==== *[As an API Provider]* Setup 3scale entities for version 2.0.0

. Run this command from the command prompt from where you have cloned the ansible playbook.
** This command will use the git branch `2.0.0` as the source of truth since we are now rolling out version `2.0.0`
** This command will create version 2.0.0 of 3scale Backend, Product, Application Plans, Developer Account and the Application for the account as well
+
[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
ansible-playbook playbook.yml  --skip-tags "main" --extra-vars "apim_gitops_repo_value=https://github.com/rh-soln-pattern-api-versioning/api-versioning-helm apim_gitops_repo_tag_value=2.0.0"
----
** The output will be like this
+
```
PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=12   changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=3    rescued=0    ignored=0
```

. From 3scale promote APICast configuration from *Globex Order Placement Product -> Integration -> Configuration -> *Promote to v.x Staging APICast* and *Promote to v.x Production APICast* 

. A new Backend has been added  mapped to `/v2` path.
. Navigate to *Globex Order Placement Product-> Integration ->  Methods and Metrics* and note that a new method for `v2` has been added
+
image::methods-v200.png[]
. Navigate to the *Mapping Rules* menu and note that a new rule for `/v2` has bee added which will direct all api calls with `/v2` to the new version 2.0.0 backend
+
image::mapping-rules-200.png[]
. Promote APICast configuration from Integration -> Configuration -> *Promote to v.x Staging APICast* and *Promote to v.x Production APICast* 
. You now have 2 Backends configured which would both work correctly when invoked via /v1/ and /v2/ paths. 
+
image::config-200.png[]

==== *[As an API Consumer]* Update UI to version 2.0.0

. Run this command to update the image of globex-ui deployment to the 2.0.0 version
+
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
oc set image deployment/globex-ui globex-ui=quay.io/rh_soln_pattern_api_versioning/globex-ui:2.0.0 -n globex-user1
----
. Run the following command to update the backend service's env variables.
+
[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
oc set env deployments/globex-ui --overwrite API_USER_KEY_VALUE=$API_USER_KEY_VALUE  \
API_TRACK_PLACEORDER=https://globex-order-placement-product-3scale-user1-apicast-staging.%SUBDOMAIN%/v2/placeorder -n globex-user1
----

==== Testing this out (version 2.0.0)
. Launch the https://globex-ui-globex-user1.%SUBDOMAIN%/[retail website^] preferrably in incognito - or perform a hard refresh of the browser to nullify caching. 
. Login using any valid email address and any 6-digit password.
. Navigate to the *Cool Stuff Store* from the top menu. Add a few things to the card and proceed to checkout
. Notice that there is a new field called *Delivery Instructions*. Provide some content for this new field, and click on *Submit Order*
+
image::globex-ui-combined-name.png[]
* You should see a confirmation message that the order has been placed.
* Navigate to the webhook.site you have setup to check that the *delivery_instructions* is being passed on correctly
+
image::combined-name-webhook.png[]

==== View Traffic Analytics of version 2.0.0
. Try placing a few orders to generate traffic. You can also place dummy orders as dicussed earlier
. Navigate to https://3scale-user1-admin.%SUBDOMAIN%[3scale Dashboard^,window=3scale], and click on *globex-order-placement* to view the Product Details
. Click on the *Analytics -> Traffic* link on the left hand side menu. You will see the *Hits* details split between the versions v1 and v2.
+
image:apim-traffic-200.png[]


===  Alternatives to introduce Version 2.0.0

You may consider creating a new Product for version 2.0.0, or perhaps create a new application plan. These decisions will need to be made in the context of how the teams function, and what is relevant for the teams involved.

===  Step 5: Manage and Analyse: Analytics, consumer notification

Especially with introduction of a breaking change, you will like to sunset your older version of the API at the earliest. You will need to start by notifying the consumers.

. Navigate to https://3scale-user1-admin.apps.cluster-w6wln.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io/buyers/accounts[Audience (from top menu) -> Accounts -> Listing^]. 
. You will the number of applications the Globex user has signed for. (in this case it is 2). You can search for the Accounts which have signed up for the Order Placment API by using the search term *Globex Basic*
+
image::audience-acc-listing.png[]
. You can also drill downn to an account by clicking on the hyperlink [2] 
. From the *Applications for Globex Page* click the "x Applications" link on top
+
image::globex-acc-listing.png[]
* You can now choose the relevants accounts to view the *Bulk operations* available.
+
image::bulk-ops.png[]
* Click on *Send email* to send a notification saying something like this. 
```
Subject: Basic Plan of Globex Order Placement version 1.1.0 deprecation
Body of Email:
Hello
Please note that Globex Order Placement version 1.1.0 is being deprecated and will not be available for new signups. The version 1.1.0 will be removed by <date>.
Please refer to the Developer Portal for details of version 2.0.0
```
=== Make the 1.1.0 version unavailable for signups

Once you are ready to sunset the older version here is what you can do:

* Navigate to *Products -> Globex Order Placement -> Applications -> Application Plans*
* Click on the green checkboxes for Enabled and Visible columns for the `Method version 1.0.0` to make it red as shown below.
+
image::method-v100-off.png[]
* All calls to /v1/ will now fail authentication.
