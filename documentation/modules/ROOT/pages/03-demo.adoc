= See the Solution in Action

== Setup the solution

To provision the demo you will perform the following steps - each of which are explained in detail in the next sections:

* Gain access to Red Hat OpenShift. This solution pattern has been tested on https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/welcome/index.html[OpenShift 4.15^]
* Ensure you have the tools `oc` and `ansible` installed in your local environment such as your laptop
* Access the OpenShift cluster with cluster-admin privileges
* Log in to OpenShift with `cluster-admin` role via cli
* Run the Ansible playbook
* Run a bunch of scripts to deploy the Solution Pattern in your OpenShift cluster

// [%interactive]
//* [ ] Binge watch Death in Paradise
//* [ ] Visit a tropical island

=== Pre-requisites
Here is the list of tools you need in your local environment so that you can use the automated installation.

* https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[OpenShift CLI (oc client)^]
* https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html[Ansible CLI ^] with https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/kubernetes/core/k8s_module.html[Ansible kubernetes.core module^]

To check if you have the cli tools, you can open your terminal and use following commands:

******
[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
oc version #openshift cli client
ansible --version
ansible-galaxy --version
ansible-galaxy collection list #the list should include kubernetes.core
----
******

If you can't see `kubernetes.core` collection listed, you can install it with `ansible-galaxy`:
******
[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
ansible-galaxy collection install kubernetes.core
----
******

=== Installing the demo

* Login to your OpenShift cluster as cluster-admin (because a number of operators will need to be installed)
* Click on the username on the top right hand, and then click on *Copy login command*. This will open another tab and you will need to login again
* Click on *Display token* link, and copy the command under *Log in with this token*. This will look like this
******
[source,shell script]
----
oc login --token=<token> --server=<server>
----
******

* Clone the ansible scripts as follows in an appropriate folder in your local environment
******
[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
git clone https://github.com/rh-solution-pattern-api-versioning/globex-ansible
----
******

Run the following command to setup the fundamental config needed. Ensure that the ansible playbook is deployed without errors

******
[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --skip-tags "apim"
----
******

* This is the output you get from the above ansible command:

[example]
----
PLAY RECAP ****************************************************************************************
localhost         : ok=86  changed=17  unreachable=0  failed=0  skipped=31  rescued=0  ignored=0 
----

That's it! You are set to try out this Solution Pattern! ｡◕‿◕｡

=== Personalize the instructions

* At the top-right of this page enter 
** *subdomain* to match your OpenShift cluster under the *Your Workshop Environment* section 
* Press enter or click on the Set button
+
image::setup-instructions.png[]
* The menubar and the rest of this walkthrough guide will be updated with the username and subdomain as shown below
+
image::setup-instructions-complete.png[]

[NOTE]
=====
The subdomain would look something like this `apps.cluster-name.guid.subdomain.myopenshift.com`
=====

[#_walkthrough_guide]
== Workshop Walkthrough guide

Here is an overview of what you will achieve

image::steps.png[]

[NOTE]
====
The Design, Govern and Mock phases of API lifecycle have been discussed in other https://redhat-solution-patterns.github.io/solution-pattern-api-first[solutions patterns^]; so in this pattern we will skip straight to the implementing API versioning. So, this solution pattern focuses on how 3scale API management and OpenShift can help with API versioning. 

====


== Step 1: Overview

Let's walk through an overview of the components that have been setup already

* Launch the https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%[OpenShift console^,window=console] and login
* Navigate to *Topology* from the Developer's view of the `globex-user1` project
+
image::globex-user1.png[]
** The center section under the name *globex-app-user1* contains the components needed for the first version of the application and the api.
*** `globex-ui` is the retail website
*** `order-placement` is the microservice which implements the OrderPlacement API. This service validates incoming payload against JSON Schema of the OpenAPI spec.
*** `catalog` and `inventory` components provide the services needed for the retail websites.
** The left section *v1-1* is the (future looking) setup for v1-1. 
*** This is at zero pods at the moment because the corresponding API version is not setup yet
** The right *v2-0* is the (future looking) setup for v2-0. 
*** This is at zero pods at the moment because the corresponding API version is not setup yet

== Step 2: Enable Version 1.0.0

=== API specification and governance

The version 1.0.0 of this *Globex Order Placement API* has already been created for you. This can be viewed in github https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rh-soln-pattern-api-versioning/api-spec/main/v1.0/OrderPlacementAPI-V1.0.yaml[here^]. You can note how the version is represented in the following snippet

```
openapi: 3.0.2
info:
  title: OrderPlacementAPI V1.0
  version: 1.0.0
  description: 'API Call to place an order with product, address and user details'
```

=== As a backend developer

*Setup OrderPlacement backend service*

The backend of OrderPlacement API for the purpose of this demo, acts as a facade to receive the payload, and then posts the Order payload to a https://webhook.site/[https://webhook.site/^]. 

[TIP]
====
In real life, there are a number ways this payload can be handled

* payload maybe be processed asynchronously through a event driven architecture
* payload maybe stored in a SQL based database or a no-SQL database
* payload may need to be posted to a number of other downstream systems.
====

* As seen earlier, the OrderPlacement backend service has already been provisioned for you. You will now need to
* The *ORDER_PLACEMENT_API* env variable of the OrderPlacement backend service has a placeholder which needs to be replaced.
+
image::order-placement-config-before.png[]
+
* Launch https://webhook.site/[https://webhook.site/^], and copy the the URL displayed as *Your unique URL* by clicking on it 
+
image::webhook-site-unique-url.png[]
* From your command prompt, set an environment variable
+
******
```
export WEBHOOKSITE=<webhoot.site url that you copied in the previous step>
```
******

* Run the following command to update the backend service's environment variables.
+
******
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
oc set env deployments/order-placement --overwrite ORDER_PLACEMENT_API=$WEBHOOKSITE -n globex-user1
----
******

** You will see the output `deployment.apps/order-placement updated`
** This is how the env variables of the https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/k8s/ns/globex-user1/deployments/order-placement/environment[Order Placement service^,window=console] will look like after update. 
+
image::order-placement-config-after.png[]

* Any payload being POSTed to this service will now be sent to this webhook site for inspection. 
+
[TIP]
====
Instead of a plain JSON order payload, you can consider the payload to be a https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents^]. CloudEvents can then hold versions in their headers which makes it easier to route to different downstream systems through (for e.g.) using Knative Eventing 
====

=== As an API Provider

*Setup 3scale entities*

Just like the code, all the 3scale Custom Resources are also maintained in git and are managed through ArgoCD/GitOps. This helps to version the 3scale entities as well.

. Run this command from where you have cloned the ansible playbook in the first step.
* This command will use the git branch `1.0.0` as the source of truth since we start with version `1.0.0`
* This command will create version 1.0.0 of 3scale Backend, Product, Application Plans, Developer Account and the Application for the account as well
+
******
[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --skip-tags "main" --extra-vars "apim_gitops_repo_value=https://github.com/rh-soln-pattern-api-versioning/api-versioning-helm apim_gitops_repo_tag_value=1.0.0"
----
******

. The above command setup up an ArgoCD application which is responsible for the 3scale custom resources
+
.[.underline]*Click to learn how to access ArgoCD*
[%collapsible]
====
* From the OpenShift console, click on the Clutser Argo CD menu
+
image::argo-cd-menu.png[]
* You will next need to get the ArgoCD admin credentials. 
* Access this from `openshift-gitops-cluster` secret in the openshift-gitops namespace. Launch https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/k8s/ns/openshift-gitops/secrets/openshift-gitops-cluster[openshift-gitops-cluster here^,window=console]
* Copy the *admin.password* from the bottom of this page
* Login to ArgoCD with *username*: _admin_ and *password*: _from openshift-gitops-cluster secret_
* You will note that there are a number of Argo applications
+
image::argo-apps.png[]
* The *apim-user1* contains all of the 3scale custom resources. Go ahead and explore this - you will see Product, Backend, Developer Account amongst other things.

====

. Click on https://3scale-user1-admin.%SUBDOMAIN%[3scale^,window=3scale] to view all the entities that have been created for you. Login using (user1/openshift)
+
image:apim-v100-overview.png[] 
. Note that the *Globex Order Placement Product* and *Globex Order Placement Backend* are now created.
. *ActiveDoc* can be viewed under *Globex Order Placement Product -> ActiveDocs*
+
[NOTE] 
====
* ActiveDoc is created with OpenApi Specs. For the purpose of this solution pattern we are using a prebuilt OpenAPI. 
* Apicurio API designer is a great tool to build API designs. You can then manage it with Apicurio Service Registry
====

. Click on *Globex Order Placement Product* navigate to *Product-> Integration -> Methods and Metrics* to view what's been setup.
+
[NOTE]
====
Methods and Metrics help map different backend services to different paths representing URL versions, and also help to track metrics based on hits for different backend service versions
====
+
image::methods-100.png[]

. Now click on *Mapping Rules* link. The Mapping rules help to route a request to the right version of backend service (e.g. /v1/placeorder)
+
```
E.g. `api.globex.com/v1/OrderPlacement` will go to `v1` backend service
```
+
image::methods-v100-mapping-rules.png[]
** The Mapping Rule with the pattern `/{version}` also helps to track all the metrics to Globex Order Placement API in total.
*** `Order Placement API` tracks all hits made to the API irrespective of which version
** The Mapping Rule with the pattern `/v1` also helps to track all the metrics to Globex Order Placement API in total.
*** `Method version 1.0.0` tracks hits made to the 1.1.0 API version which accessed by path */v1* only

. Before you can start accessing the Globex Order Placement API, you must promote the APIcast configuration as below. +
+
.[.underline]*Click to view what is APICast*
[%collapsible]
====
APIcast is an NGINX based API gateway used to integrate your internal and external API services with the Red Hat 3scale Platform. In this workshop we use the two built-in APICast (staging and production) that come by default with the 3scale installation. They come pre-configured and ready to use out-of-the-box.
====

. From the left hand menu, navigate to *Integration* -> *Backend* to view the *Globex Order Placement Backend*. +
*Note* The _Public path_ to access this version is */v1*
+
image::apim-backend100.png[]

. From the https://3scale-user1-admin.%SUBDOMAIN%[3scale homepage^,window=3scale], under the Products section, click on *Globex Order Placement* to view the Product's overview page. From the left hand menu, navigate to *Integration* -> *Configuration*
+
******
Under *APIcast Configuration*, click *Promote to v.x Staging APICast* to promote the APIcast configurations. Similarly click *Promote to v.x Production APICast* 
******
+
image::apim-promote-prod.png[]

* Note that *Globex Order Placement Backend* shows that the backend is mapped as "v1". The API will then be accessed via *v1* path. This helps in versioning this OrderPlacement API as *1.0.0*

=== As an API Consumer
*Globex UI patched with API Credentials and APICast URL*

Next step, patch the `globex-ui` deployment with the API credentials and the APIcast URL. Typically developers get APICredentials from the Developer Portal. 

. In 3scale, navigate to *Audience (from top nav) -> Developer Portal -> Visit Portal*
+
image::access-devportal.png[]
 
. Sign in using (*dev.globex/openshift*)
+
image::dev-portal-login.png[]
. Click on *API credentials* link on top nav, and you will see *Globex Basic Application* 
** Copy the alphanumeric value found as *User Key* and create environment variable `API_USER_KEY_VALUE`
+
image::application-credentials-1.0.png[]
+
******
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
export API_USER_KEY_VALUE=<replace with user key>
----
******
** Run the following command to update the backend service's env variables.
+
******
[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
oc set env deployments/globex-ui --overwrite API_USER_KEY_VALUE=$API_USER_KEY_VALUE \
API_TRACK_PLACEORDER=https://globex-order-placement-product-3scale-user1-apicast-staging.%SUBDOMAIN%/v1/placeorder -n globex-user1
----
******

** You should see an output message `deployment.apps/globex-ui updated`


=== Testing this out

. Launch the https://globex-ui-globex-user1.%SUBDOMAIN%/products[retail website^]
. Login using any valid email address and any 6-digit password - since this is just a simulation.
. Navigate to the *Cool Stuff Store* from the top menu. Add a few things to the cart. 
. Click on *Cart* from the top menu and *Proceed to Checkout*. 
. Click on the *Autofill form* button to make it easy to fill this form. 
+
image::globex-ui-v-100.png[]
. Click on *Submit Order*
. You must see a success message
+
image::globex-ui-order-submit.png[]

. You can view the payload on the webhook.site that you setup
+
image::webhook-v100.png[]

=== View Traffic Analytics
. Try placing a few orders to generate traffic. 
. Navigate to https://3scale-user1-admin.%SUBDOMAIN%[3scale Dashboard^,window=3scale], and click on *globex-order-placement* to view the Product Details
. Click on the *Analytics -> Traffic* link on the left hand side menu. You will see the *Hits* details. 
. This section provides insights in terms of the number of hits for the product and other traffic analysis details as well.
+
image:apim-traffic.png[]
 

== Step 3: Enable Version 1.1.0

Globex now wants to capture a new field called *Delivery Instructions* to make it easier to make prompt deliveries This is considered as a non-breaking change because this is an optional field. To handle the new field, let's introduce version 1.1.0 of OrderPlacement API. 

This change has varying degrees of  impact across the different stakeholders (provider, developer & consumer)

.[.underline]*Click to view a summary*
[%collapsible]
=====
. As an *API provider*
** Use APICurio studio to make changes to OpenAPI Specification to include Optional field *Delivery Instructions* and change version from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0
** Publish this on Apicurio Service Registry
** Update 3scale for new Backend (version 1.1.0), update Product to point to the Backend version 1.1.0, update ActivdDoc
** Point to new Backend service which adheres to the new API specification
+
[NOTE]
====
As mentioned earlier the APICurio studio and Apicurio Service Registry changes are not included to keep this solution pattern accessible and not overtly too lengthy.
====

. As a *Backend service developer*
** Create a new branch with name *v1.1.0* and change the Order Placement service to allow for *Delivery Instructions*
** Update any POJOs or mapping - ideally it is better to handle this as a JSON payload rather than mapping to a POJO so as to allow for minimal impact
** Update validations against new OpenAPI spec. In our case we use JSON Schema based validation.

. As an *API consumer*
** May choose to consume the new API at their own pace.
** Changes includ update to the UI to allow for the new field *Delivery Instructions*. 
** Change any validations if necessary. Ensure adherence to new OpenAPI specification

=====

=== As a backend developer
*Deploy new version 1.1.0 of the backend service*

. The backend service deployment for version 1.1.0 has been already deployed as part of the setup to keep things simpler for the demo, but is set as replica 0 (i.e, it is at zero pods)
. The OpenAPI specification has been updated with optional *Delivery Instructions*. You can view the version https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rh-soln-pattern-api-versioning/api-spec/main/v1.1/OrderPlacementAPI-V1.1.yaml[1.1.0 here^]
+
```
openapi: 3.0.2
info:
  title: OrderPlacementAPI V1.1
  version: 1.1.0
  description: 'API Call to place an order with product, address and user details'  
......
    delivery_instructions:
     description: Send optional delivery instructions
......
```
. The OpenAPI specification for this version 1.1.0 has been converted ionto JSON Schema and is part of this backend service. Click here to view the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rh-soln-pattern-api-versioning/order-placement-service/1.1.0/src/main/java/org/globex/retail/json-schema/order-placement-payload.json[version 1.1.0 JSON Schema^]. Note the introduction of *delivery_instructions* field which is optional
+
image::json-schema-v110.png[width=50%]
. Patch the `order-placement-v1-1-0` deployment with the webhook.site URL that you have setup earlier. 
* From your command prompt `echo $WEBHOOKSITE` to make sure you have the env variable accessible
+
******
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
echo $WEBHOOKSITE
----
******

* Run the following command to update the backend service's environment variables, and scale the replica to `1`
+
******
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
oc set env deployments/order-placement-v1-1-0 --overwrite ORDER_PLACEMENT_API=$WEBHOOKSITE -n globex-user1
oc scale deployment order-placement-v1-1-0 --replicas=1 -n globex-user1
----
******


*** Output would be like this
+
```
deployment.apps/order-placement-v1-1-0 updated
deployment.apps/order-placement-v1-1-0 scaled
```

=== As an API Provider
*Configure 3scale entities for version 1.1.0*

. Run this command from the command prompt from where you have cloned the ansible playbook.
** This command will use the git branch `1.1.0` as the source of truth since we are now rolling out version `1.1.0`
** This command will create version 1.1.0 of 3scale Backend, Product, Application Plans, Developer Account and the Application for the account as well
+
******
[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --skip-tags "main" --extra-vars "apim_gitops_repo_value=https://github.com/rh-soln-pattern-api-versioning/api-versioning-helm apim_gitops_repo_tag_value=1.1.0"
----
******

** The output will be like this
+
```
PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************************************************************
localhost         : ok=12  changed=1  unreachable=0  failed=0  skipped=3  rescued=0  ignored=0
```
. You can access ArgoCD as described earlier to view the new entities for v1.1.0 being deployment (including new Backend, updates to the Product)
. From 3scale promote APICast configuration from *Globex Order Placement Product -> Integration -> Configuration -> *Promote to v.x Staging APICast* and *Promote to v.x Production APICast* 

=== As an API Consumer
*Update UI to updated version 1.1.0*


[TIP]
====
This is a backward compatible change. Therefore, the existing *globex-ui 1.0.0* deployment will work as it is without any changes with the new *Backend 1.1.0* version. You can test this out just to be sure :)
====

When the UI developers are ready, they can make the following changes to start consuming the new changes, and send the new Delivery Instructions as part of the order payload.

. Run this command to update the image of globex-ui deployment to the 1.1.0 version
******
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
oc set image deployment/globex-ui globex-ui=quay.io/rh_soln_pattern_api_versioning/globex-ui:1.1.0 -n globex-user1
----
******

=== Testing this out
. Launch the https://globex-ui-globex-user1.%SUBDOMAIN%/products[retail website^] preferably in incognito - or perform a hard refresh of the browser to nullify caching. 
. Login using any valid email address and any 6-digit password.
. Navigate to the *Cool Stuff Store* from the top menu. Add a few things to the card and proceed to checkout
. Notice that there is a new field called *Delivery Instructions*. Provide some content for this new field, and click on *Submit Order*
+
image::delivery-instructions.png[]
. You should see a confirmation message that the order has been placed.
. Navigate to the webhook.site you have setup to check that the *delivery_instructions* is being passed on correctly
+
image::delivery-instructions-webhook.png[]


== Step 4: Enable Version 2.0.0
Further down the line, Globex would like to merge *First name and Last name* into a single field to better represent different cultures and conventions. 

This is considered as a breaking change since there is no backward compatibility leading to a major version change to OpenAPI spec *version 2.0.0*

The version 2.0.0 of this *Globex Order Placement API* has already been created for you. This can be viewed in github https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rh-soln-pattern-api-versioning/api-spec/main/v2.0/OrderPlacementAPI-V2.0.yaml[here^].  


The same set of impacts identified across the different stakeholders while introducing version 1.1.0 also applies for a Major version change. The main impact is that, this version is NOT backward compatible.

=== As a backend developer
*New version 2.0.0 of the backend service*

. The backend service deployment for version 2.0.0 is in place to keep this pattern simple, but is set as replica 0 (i.e, it is at zero pods)
** The OpenAPI specification for this version 2.0.0 has been converted into JSON Schema and is part of this backend service. Click here to view the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rh-soln-pattern-api-versioning/order-placement-service/2.0.0/src/main/java/org/globex/retail/json-schema/order-placement-payload.json[version 2.0.0 JSON Schema^]. Note the introduction of *name* field which is not optional, and has replaced first name and last name  fields.
+
image::json-schema-v200.png[width=50%]

. You will need to patch this deployment as well with the *webhook.site URL* that you have setup earlier. 
** From your command prompt `echo $WEBHOOKSITE` to make sure you have the env variable accessible
+
******
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
echo $WEBHOOKSITE
----
******

** Run the following command to update the `order-placement-v2-0` service's environment variables, and scale the replica to `1`
+
******
[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
oc set env deployments/order-placement-v2-0 --overwrite ORDER_PLACEMENT_API=$WEBHOOKSITE -n globex-user1
oc scale deployments/order-placement-v2-0 --replicas=1 -n globex-user1
----
******

*** Output would be like this
+
```
deployment.apps/order-placement-v2-0 updated
deployment.apps/order-placement-v2-0 scaled
```

=== As an API Provider
*Setup 3scale entities for version 2.0.0*

. Run this command from the command prompt from where you have cloned the ansible playbook.
** This command will use the git branch `2.0.0` as the source of truth since we are now rolling out version `2.0.0`
** This command will create version 2.0.0 of 3scale Backend, Product, Application Plans, Developer Account and the Application for the account as well

** The output will be like this
+
```
PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************************************************************
localhost         : ok=12  changed=1  unreachable=0  failed=0  skipped=3  rescued=0  ignored=0
```

. From 3scale promote APICast configuration from *Globex Order Placement Product -> Integration -> Configuration -> *Promote to v.x Staging APICast* and *Promote to v.x Production APICast* 

. Note from *Globex Order Placement Product-> Integration -> Backend* that new Backend has been added mapped to `/v2` path.
+

. Navigate to *Globex Order Placement Product-> Integration -> Methods and Metrics* and note that a new method for `v2` has been added
+
image::methods-v200.png[]
. Navigate to the *Mapping Rules* menu and note that a new rule for `/v2` has been added which will direct all api calls with `/v2` to the new version 2.0.0 backend
+
image::mapping-rules-200.png[]
. Promote APICast configuration 
******
* Promote APICast configuration from Integration -> Configuration -> *Promote to v.x Staging APICast* and *Promote to v.x Production APICast* 
* You now have 2 Backends configured which would both work correctly when invoked via /v1/ and /v2/ paths. 
+

=== View Traffic Analytics
. Try placing a few orders to generate traffic. You can also place dummy orders as discussed earlier.
. Navigate to https://3scale-user1-admin.%SUBDOMAIN%[3scale Dashboard^,window=3scale], and click on *Globex Order Placement Product* to view the Product Details
. Click on the *Analytics -> Traffic* link on the left hand side menu. You will see the *Hits* details split between the versions v1 and v2.
+
image:apim-traffic-200.png[]


== Step 5: Manage and Analyse: Analytics, consumer notification

Especially with the introduction of a breaking change, you will like to sunset your older version of the API at the earliest. You will need to start by notifying the consumers.

. Navigate to https://3scale-user1-admin.apps.cluster-w6wln.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io/buyers/accounts[Audience (from top menu) -> Accounts -> Listing^]. 
. You will see the number of applications the Globex user has signed for. (in this case it is 2). You can search for the Accounts which have signed up for the Order Placement API by using the search term *Globex Basic*
+

. You can also drill down to an account by clicking on the hyperlink [2] 
. From the *Applications for Globex Page* click the "x Applications" link on top
+

. You can now choose the relevant accounts to view the *Bulk operations* available.

. Click on *Send email* to send a notification saying something like this.

Subject: Basic Plan of Globex Order Placement version 1.1.0 deprecation
Body of Email:
Hello
Please note that Globex Order Placement version 1.1.0 is being deprecated and will not be available for new signups. The version 1.1.0 will be removed by <date>.
Please refer to the Developer Portal for details of version 2.0.0
```

=== Make the 1.1.0 version unavailable for signups

Once you are ready to sunset the older version here is what you can do:

* Navigate to *Products -> Globex Order Placement -> Applications -> Application Plans*
* Click on the green checkboxes for Enabled and Visible columns for the `Method version 1.0.0` to make it red as shown below.
+

* All calls to /v1/ will now fail authentication.

== Alternatives to introducing new versions

In this pattern we continued to use the same Application Plan for all revisions. In the real world, there are options that can be considered based on the context of how the teams function, and what is relevant for business. 

=== New 3scale Product
For breaking changes, you may consider creating a new 3scale Product for version 2.0.0. Once you are ready to sunset the version 1.x.x, just delete the product.

=== New application plan
You may also consider creating a new application plan for the new version. Here is how this would pan out

. In the Existing application plan, turn off access to version 2.0.0 Backend
+
image::edit-app-plan-100.png[]
. Create a new application plan for version 2.0.0
+
image::app-plan-200.png[]
. Unpublish the older application plan by changing the *State* to hidden. 
+
image::hide-app-plan-100.png[]
* This means that all new users will only be able to sign up to the newer plan; when version 1.x.x is being sunset, you can just delete all those applications and the plan itself

== Conclusion

Congratulations on completing this Solution Pattern. As a takeaway

* APIs are very useful as building blocks for internal and external system integrations
* Don't change frequently - but have a public strategy in place to have predictable releases and consumer notification
* Consider including Release Notes in your developer portal with access to OpenAPI Specs, trials and code samples
* GitOps and ArgoCD are you friends to make this manageable and trackable

To sum up, build *Intentional APIs*
